abstract = {U.S. government fuel economy tests are used for two primary purposes: 1) to monitor automobile manufacturers’ compliance with fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards and 2) to inform consumers about the fuel economy of passenger cars and light trucks. This study analyzes a unique database of 75,000 fuel economy estimates self-reported by customers of the U.S. government website www.fueleconomy.gov to evaluate the effectiveness of the government's estimates for these two purposes. The analysis shows great variability in individuals’ own fuel economy estimates relative to the official government estimates with a small bias relative to the sample average. For consumers, the primary limitation of government fuel economy estimates is imprecision for a given individual rather than bias relative to the average individual. The analysis also examines correlations between individuals’ fuel economy estimates and specific technologies, vehicle class, driving style, method used to calculate fuel economy, manufacturer, and state. Gasoline, hybrid and diesel vehicles were separately evaluated. There is some evidence that the shortfall between test cycle fuel economy estimates (used to measure compliance with regulations) and in-use fuel economy estimates (such as those provided by customers of www.fueleconomy.gov) has been increasing since 2005. If this trend continues, it could affect the benefits realized by fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards. A scientifically designed survey of in-use fuel economy is needed to insure that an unbiased sample is collected and that fuel economy is rigorously and consistently measured for all vehicles. The potential for information technology to enable more precise prediction of individual fuel economy should be explored.

abstract = {•This study analyzes a unique longitudinal database of more than 600,000 odometer and fuel purchase diaries.•Multilevel models are estimated to untangle within- and between-vehicle variations of the fuel economy.•The fuel economy of hybrid vehicles increases over the first 3000 miles, then gradually decreases.•Increasing miles traveled per day results in substantially increased fuel economy.•Temperature affects hybrid vehicles more strongly than gasoline vehicles.
Understanding the fuel economy of vehicles in actual use has important implications for fuel economy, greenhouse gas emission and consumer information policies. This study explores how fuel economy varies with intensity of daily vehicle use, cumulative mileage, and ambient temperature. Using a unique longitudinal database, we quantify variations in fuel economy (miles per gallon or MPG) over time for the same vehicle. The database consists of more than 600,000 odometer and fuel purchase records, obtained from the “My MPG” section of the http://fueleconomy.gov website. Over 10,000 drivers reported their fuel purchases and vehicle usage, with an average of 36 fill-ups per vehicle. Multilevel models are used to analyze and compare relationships for conventional gasoline and hybrid vehicles. For gasoline vehicles, within-vehicle variation accounts for 23% total variation of fuel economy and 77% is between-vehicle variation. For hybrids, the equivalent proportions are 19% and 81%. On-road fuel economy increases nonlinearly with cumulative mileage, with nearly all of the increase occurring within the first few thousand miles. The estimated trend for hybrid vehicles is very different from that of conventional gasoline vehicles. Hybrids were found to have higher daily miles of use than conventional gasoline vehicles. Cold temperatures appear to have a greater effect on the fuel economy of hybrids than conventional gasoline vehicles.},

abstract = {The key objective of this study is to investigate the interrelationship between fuel economy gaps and to quantify the differential effects of several factors on fuel economy gaps of vehicles operated by the same garage. By using a unique fuel economy database (fueleconomy.gov), users' self-reported fuel economy estimates and government's fuel economy ratings are analyzed for more than 7000 garages across the United States. The empirical analysis, nonetheless, is complicated owing to the presence of important methodological concerns including potential interrelationship between vehicles within the same garage and unobserved heterogeneity. To address these concerns, bivariate seemingly unrelated fixed and random parameter models are presented. With government's test cycle ratings tending to over-estimate the actual on-road fuel economy, a significant variation is observed in the fuel economy gaps for the two vehicles across garages. A wide variety of factors such as driving style, fuel economy calculation method, and several vehicle-specific characteristics are considered. Drivers who drive for maximum gas mileage or drives with the traffic flow have greater on-road fuel economy relative to the government's ratings. Contrarily, volatile drivers have smaller on-road fuel economy relative to the official ratings. Compared to the previous findings, our analysis suggests that the relationship between fuel type and fuel economy gaps is complex and not unidirectional. Regarding several vehicle and manufacturer related variables, the effects do not just significantly vary in magnitude but also in the direction, underscoring the importance of accounting for within-garage correlation and unobserved heterogeneity for making reliable inferences.},
